1.  Introduction

   In this document we are identifying a problem of transferring digital
   credentials (e.g. a digital car key, a digital key a a hotel room or
   a digital key to a private house) from a wallet on one device
   (smartphone) to another, particularly, if these devices belong to two
   different platforms (e.g. one is iOS, another - Android).  Today,
   there is no widely accepted way of transferring digital credentials
   securely between two digital wallets independent of hardware and
   software manufacturer.  This document describes the problem space and
   the requirements for the solution the working group creates.

   A Working Group, called Tigress has been established to find a
   solution to the problem described above.  Within the WG an initial
   solution was presented (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-art-
   tigress).  The community decided to generalize the requirements to
   the solution and consider alternative solutions within the WG.

   This document presents the general requirements to possible solutions
   and specifies certain privacy requirements in order to maintain a
   high level of user privacy.

2.  General Setting

   When sharing digital secure credentials, there are several actors
   involved.  This document will focus on sharing information between
   two digital wallets, directly or through an intermediary server.

   Digital credentials provide access to property owned and operated by
   3-rd party entities, such as hotel or residential building owners.
   The entity that is providing the digital credential for consumption
   by a digital wallet are referred to as Provisioning Partners.
   Provisioning Partner require to have control over digital credential
   issuance and life time management.  Each digital wallet has a
   preexisting trust relationship between itself and the Provisioning
   Partner (authentication and authorization in order to access to API
   endpoints).

   Digital wallet is a combination of software and hardware in a
   smartphone device, there are two devices involved in credentail
   transfer process - Sender and Receiver.  They are defined in terms of
   which one is a transfer initiator (Sender) and which device is
   eventually consuming transferred credentials (Receiver).  Device
   roles can change based on the transfer direction - in some transfers
   a device can act as a Sender, in other - as a Receiver.

   The interface between the device and the Provisioning Partner can be
   proprietary or a part of published specifications.  The sender wallet
   obtains provisioning information from the Provisioning Partner, then
   shares it to the recipient using a solution defined in Tigress WG.
   The recipient then takes that provisioning information and sends it
   to the Provisioning Partner to redeem for credential for consumption
   in a digital wallet.

   For some credential types the Provisioning Partner who issues new
   credentials is actually the sender wallet.  In that scenario the
   receiver will generate a new key material at the request of the
   sender, and then communicate with the sender over Tigress to have its
   key material signed by the sender.  New credential, with the key
   material generated by receiver device and signed by sender device,
   will finally be added (provisioned) into a digital wallet on sender
   device.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   General terms:

   *  Credential information - data used to authenticate the user with
      an access point.

   *  Provisioning information - data transferred from Sender to
      Receiver device that is both necessary and sufficient for the
      Receiver to request a new credential from Provisioning Partner to
      provision it to the Receiver device.

   *  Provisioning - A process of adding a new credential to the device.

   *  Provisioning Partner - an entity which facilitates Credential
      Information lifecycle on a device.  Lifecycle may include
      provisioning of credential, credential termination, credential
      update.

   *  Sender (device) - a device initiating a transfer of Provisioning
      Information to a Receiver that can provision this credential.

   *  Receiver (device) - a device that receives Provisioning
      Information and uses it to provision a new credential.

   *  Intermediary (server) - an optional intermediary server that
      provides a standardized and platform-independent way of
      transferring provisioning information between Sender and Receiver
      devices, acting as a temporary store and forward service between
      Sender and Receiver.

   *  Digital Wallet - A device, service, and/or software that
      faciliates transactions either online or in-person via a
      technology like NFC.  Digital Wallet's typically support payments,
      drivers licenses, loyalty cards, access credentials and more.

4.  Use Cases

   *  Let's say Ben owns a vehicle that supports digital car keys.  Ben
      would like to let Ryan borrow the car for the weekend.  Ryan and
      Ben are using two different devices (smartphones) with different
      operating systems.  In order for Ben to share his digital car key
      to Ryan for a weekend, he must transfer some data to the receiver
      device.  Receiver device generates new key material and return it
      to the sender to sign and return back to the receiver.  At this
      point, the receiver now has a token that will allow them to
      provision their new key with the car.

   *  Bob booked a room at a hotel for the weekend, but will be arriving
      late at night.  Alice, his partner, comes to the hotel first, so
      Bob wants to share his digital room key with Alice.  Bob and Alice
      are using two different mobile phones with different operating
      systems.  In order for Bob to share his digital room key to Alice
      for a weekend, he must transfer some data to her device.  The data
      structure shared between the two participants is proprietary to
      the given hotel chain (or Provisioning Partner).  This data
      transfer is a one-time, unidirectional transfer from Bob's device
      to Alice's.  Once Alice receives this data, she can provision a
      new key to her digital wallet, making a call to Provisioning
      Partner to receive new credential information.
